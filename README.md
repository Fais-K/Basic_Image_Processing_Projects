## Block Counter
  This program essentially finds and counts the number of blocks or shapes in an image. As an example, i have provided a tetris block image here, on which this program was able to successfully execute, identify and display the number of tetris blocks present in the image.
#### Requirements
   Python3, OpenCV, imutils, argparse
   
## Color Blocks Finder
This program identifies blocks or shapes in the image based on their color and marks a red rectangular box around the same. As an exapmle, i have provided a lego block image here, on which this program was able to successfully execute, identify and mark the chosen colored lego blocks in the image.
